        <p style="background-color: yellow; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"> LeBron James is arguably the greatest basketball player ever to have graced the earth. Born in Akron, Ohio, he was a phenom at the age of 16. He was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated and entered the NBA straight out of high school with expectations to be the best player ever to step on the court. Nicknamed "The King," he was unstoppable, carrying teams with limited talent to the finals while winning multiple MVP awards. He reached the NBA Finals eight consecutive times and faced the greatest team ever assembled for four straight years. He ranks in the top five in virtually every statistical category imaginable. Incredibly, he's still playing in his 23rd year. Since he joined the league in 2003, he has been its face. 

When you think of the NBA, you think of LeBron James. That's why he is important to me. I'm a big basketball fan, and he embodies what the game is all about. He is my GOAT (Greatest of All Time), not just because of his skills, but also because he is someone worth looking up to. He serves as a great role model, especially for African Americans. He has never been involved in any scandals and always conducts himself the right way. LeBron is also an inspiration for overcoming challenges, coming into the NBA with immense pressure and still exceeding expectations.to ever grace this earth. Born in Akron, Ohio, he was a phenom at the age of 16. He was the cover of Sports Illustrated; he came out of high school expected to be the best player ever to touch the court. He came straight out of high school and was being called the king. He was unstoppable; he carried teams with no players to the finals, while winning multiple MVPs. The guy went to 8 straight NBA finals, and went against the greatest team ever assembled 4 years in a row. He is in the top 5 in every stat you can think of. The dude is also in his 23rd year, which is insane. He's been the face of the league since he came in 2003. All I got to say is when you think of the NBA, you think of Lebron James. That's why he's important to me. I'm a big basketball guy, so he's the guy you think about. He's my Goat because he's somebody you would want to look up to, and it's not just basketball. He's a great role model, especially for African Americans. He has never been involved in anything bad, and he does everything the right way. He's also motivated for going against the odds,by coming into the NBA and having all the pressure but still succeed the expections.</p>
