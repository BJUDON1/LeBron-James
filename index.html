        <p style="background-color: yellow;"> Lebron James is the greatest basketball player to ever grace this earth. Born in Akron, Ohio, he was a phenom at the age of 16. He was the cover of Sports Illustrated; he came out of high school expected to be the best player ever to touch the court. He came straight out of high school and was being called the king. He was unstoppable; he carried teams with no players to the finals, while winning multiple MVPs. The guy went to 8 straight NBA finals, and went against the greatest team ever assembled 4 years in a row. He is in the top 5 in every stat you can think of. The dude is also in his 23rd year, which is insane. He's been the face of the league since he came in 2003. All I got to say is when you think of the NBA, you think of Lebron James. That's why he's important to me. I'm a big basketball guy, so he's the guy you think about.</p>
